# Deep-Live-Cam Server-Client Application

This repository contains a client-server application for real-time deepfake video processing. The server handles the heavy lifting of machine learning models, while the client provides a lightweight interface for interaction.

## Installation

This project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management, allowing for separate installations for the server and client components. This ensures that the client remains lightweight and doesn't require large machine learning libraries.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- TODO

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deep-live-cam-server-client.git
    cd deep-live-cam-server-client
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *   **For the Server (with ML capabilities):**
        This will install FastAPI, Uvicorn, InsightFace, ONNX Runtime, and other necessary libraries for deepfake processing.
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[server] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
        ```
        **Note:** By default, `onnxruntime-gpu` is specified in `pyproject.toml`. If you are running on a CPU-only server, you will need to manually edit `pyproject.toml` to change `onnxruntime-gpu` to `onnxruntime` before running the installation command.

    *   **For the Client (lightweight GUI):**
        This will install PyQt6 and qasync for the graphical user interface and asynchronous operations.
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[client]
        ```

## Running the Application

### Server

To start the server, navigate to the `api` directory and run:
```bash
python run.py --mode server --execution-provider cuda # Or other provider like cpu, directml, etc.
```
*(Note: Replace `cuda` with your desired execution provider. Refer to the `pyproject.toml` for `onnxruntime` variants.)*

### Client

To start the client application:
```bash
python run.py # Or your client's specific entry point
```

## Installation (Manual)

**Please be aware that the installation requires technical skills and is not for beginners. Consider downloading the prebuilt version.**


### Installation

This is more likely to work on your computer but will be slower as it utilizes the CPU.

**1. Set up Your Platform**

-   Python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) - ```iex (irm ffmpeg.tc.ht)```
-   [Visual Studio 2022 Runtimes (Windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git
cd Deep-Live-Cam
```

**3. Download the Models**

1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
2. [inswapper\_128\_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Place these files in the "**models**" folder.

**4. Install Dependencies**

We highly recommend using a `venv` to avoid issues.


For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Linux:
```bash
# Ensure you use the installed Python 3.10
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For macOS:**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) requires specific setup:

```bash
# Install Python 3.10 (specific version is important)
brew install python@3.10

# Install tkinter package (required for the GUI)
brew install python-tk@3.10

# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.10
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

** In case something goes wrong and you need to reinstall the virtual environment **

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
rm -rf venv

# Reinstall the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run:** If you don't have a GPU, you can run Deep-Live-Cam using `python run.py`. Note that initial execution will download models (~300MB).

### GPU Acceleration

**CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)**

1. Install [CUDA Toolkit 12.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-0-download-archive)
2. Install [cuDNN v8.9.7 for CUDA 12.x](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) (required for onnxruntime-gpu):
   - Download cuDNN v8.9.7 for CUDA 12.x
   - Make sure the cuDNN bin directory is in your system PATH
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu
pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.21.0
```

3. Usage:

```bash
python run.py --execution-provider cuda
```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Silicon)**

Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) specific installation:

1. Make sure you've completed the macOS setup above using Python 3.10.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-silicon
pip install onnxruntime-silicon==1.13.1
```

3. Usage (important: specify Python 3.10):

```bash
python3.10 run.py --execution-provider coreml
```

**Important Notes for macOS:**
- You **must** use Python 3.10, not newer versions like 3.11 or 3.13
- Always run with `python3.10` command not just `python` if you have multiple Python versions installed
- If you get error about `_tkinter` missing, reinstall the tkinter package: `brew reinstall python-tk@3.10`
- If you get model loading errors, check that your models are in the correct folder
- If you encounter conflicts with other Python versions, consider uninstalling them:
  ```bash
  # List all installed Python versions
  brew list | grep python
  
  # Uninstall conflicting versions if needed
  brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python@3.11 python@3.13
  
  # Keep only Python 3.10
  brew cleanup
  ```

**CoreML Execution Provider (Apple Legacy)**

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip uninstall onnxruntime onnxruntime-coreml
pip install onnxruntime-coreml==1.13.1
```

2. Usage:
